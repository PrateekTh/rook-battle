# Rook's Move

This project aims to create a simple multiplayer Chess game, as specified in the Game Assignment provided by Cuemath, at [this link](https://cuemath.notion.site/Game-Assignment-Rook-s-Move-ef5d792e3e114317ad6b8805d4fa4328?pvs=4).

The teck stack used is:

- Phaser 3 (JS Web Game Engine)
- Socket.IO (Multiplyer Support)
- Express.JS (Backend)

Let's go through all the features involved:

## Reproducing and Dependency setup

In order to test out the code, and run the game on your machine, follow the following steps:

1. Clone this GitHub Repository.
2. Install `node.js` (Required)
3. Traverse to the repo location via a terminal, and run the following in order:

   - `npm i `
   - `cd .\client\`
   - `npm i`

   This will ensure that all the dependencies are resolved, on both the client and the server end.

4. Now, two terminals will be required, one for the serve-side, and the other as a development server for the client-side.
   - **Server**: Traverse to the repository directory, and run `npm run start`
   - **Client**: Traverse to the repository directory, and run `cd.\client\`, and then start the development server using `npm run dev`

The server has been configured to listen at `Port: 3000`. Open up two(or more) tabs on the client's address (as launched by `npm run dev`) to join the game.
